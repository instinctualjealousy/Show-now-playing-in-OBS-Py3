# Show-now-playing-in-OBS-Py3
Utilized 2to3 and omitted some unnecessary/incompatible commands so it can now work with Python 3.<br>
I also modified it to sleep 4 seconds before looping instead of 2, as I felt 2 was a little fast.

Requirements (pip install):<br>
psutil<br>
pywin32

Use command<br>
`python OBS_Music_Plugin.py "PROCESS_NAME"`<br>
to start!

Feel free to script it behind the scenes, too.
